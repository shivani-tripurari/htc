## How we built it
LazyStudentsAssemble  was conjured using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, firebase and GoDaddy. We wove together HTML's structure, CSS's enchanting visuals, and JavaScript's interactivity. With the help of firebase  we summoned the magic to store and retrieve data. Our design was guided by the intuitive powers of Figma. 🧙‍♂️🔮

## Challenges we ran into
Storing and retrieving data was a task that we weren't familiar with , firebase was an easy tool but came as ta tricky tool to us due to the unfamiliarity of database and had to got stuck on it for hours. DNS is something new that we didn't even have an idea about but it was fun learning though it was hard at first , reading articles and watching yt videos made our task easier and fun.Though firebase and GoDaddy registration was something new to us , we tackled our problems by reading articles and documentation.
